q1)Which of the given options provides the increasing order of complexity of functions f1, f2, f3 and f4:

f1(n) = 2^n

f2(n) = n^(3/2)

f3(n) = nLogn

f4(n) = n^(Logn)

Answer:  f3, f2, f4, f1

Q2)Which of the following is not bounded by O(n^2)?
Answer:  n^3 / (sqrt(n))

Q3)In a competition, four different functions are observed. All the functions use a single for loop and within the for loop, same set of statements are executed.

Consider the following for loops:

  A) for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
 
  B) for(i = 0; i < n; i += 2)
 
  C) for(i = 1; i < n; i *= 2)
 
  D) for(i = n; i > -1; i /= 2)
If n is the size of input(positive), which function is the most efficient? In other words, which loop completes the fastest.


Answer: C
