1) What is the time complexity of the following code :

        int a = 0, i = N;
        while (i > 0) {
            a += i;
            i /= 2;
        }

Answer O(log N)

2) What is time complexity of following code :

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = N; i > 0; i /= 2) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                count += 1;
            }
        }
Answer: O(N)

3) What is the time complexity of the following code :

    int i, j, k = 0;
    for (i  = n/2; i <= n; i++) {
        for (j = 2; j <= n; j = j * 2) {
            k = k + n/2;
        }
    }
Answer: O(nlogn)

4) In the following C++ function, let n >= m.

    int gcd(int n, int m) {
            if (n%m ==0) return m;
            if (n < m) swap(n, m);
            while (m > 0) {
                n = n%m;
                swap(n, m);
            }
            return n;
    }
What is the time complexity of the above function assuming n > m?

Answer:Î˜(logn)
